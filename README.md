# Add the new soul - Inventory Asset Management System

This system is currently being developed by Lucas Hideki, Isabela Forti, Vinicius Noli and Cauê Gastaldi for the course "Object Oriented Development" offered by professor Dr. Lucas Oliveira at the Instituto Federal de São Paulo (IFSP - São Carlos).

The purpose of this system is to manage the inventory fixed assets of a company, allowing the tracking of locations and conditions of them during their whole life cycles. The system provides features to add, edit and exclude assets as well as locations and employees in charge for them. In addition, it is possible to import and export items through CSV files and visualize reports. 

The inventory manager designates a comission of executors, including a president, to monitor the fixed assets when an inventory check is started.
